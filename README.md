The file tr_bot.py is code for a Discord bot that automatically translates foreign languages to a target language.
The project was undertaken by a group of Hamilton College students in one night for the Colgate Gate Hacks '24 Hackathon in which we won second place.
The other file main.py was a separate idea we decided to try out during brainstorming.

The members who worked on this project are the following: Tyrone Xue, Seth Moore, Omar Kulenovic, and Jun Seo.
